# While loop loops as long as a condition is true."""A programmer was getting ready to leave for work, when his wife said,"While outside buy milk", and he never came back."""x = 5# x is always gonna be less than 5. This code prints out 5 continuously.# That is called an infinite loop.while x < 10:	print(x)# You can increment the value of x each time you loop.while x < 10:	print(x)	x += 1
