# A dictionary in real life is a set of words with their meanings.# In Python we have keys & values. Not limited to words & definitions. You can use numbers as well."""To create a dictionary: Give it a name & inside curly braces pass in sets of keys and values separated with commas."""pals = {'Tom': 25, 'Steve': 22, 'Vinny': 24, 'Emma': 23, 'Abraham': 26}# Print the dictionary as it is.print(pals)# Print a particular key's value: Pass in the key.print(pals['Emma'])# Loop through the Dictionary & print the keys & values.# Create 2 variables since a dictionary is made up of a set of keys & values.# k & v will store the keys and values of each item in the Dictionary as we loop through it.for k, v in pals.items():	print(k, v)
